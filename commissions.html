TL;DR<br>
-------------------------------<br>
- Forge mods ONLY for latest moddable MC verion (ask for other versions)<br>
- Payrate: around 10 GBP/h based on traffic and mod<br>
	- An additional 30 GBP if you don't want QLib as a dependency mod (unless the mod is small)<br>
- Work time estimation for the final cost is set before the commision<br>
- Final code is to be made open-source the the rights are transfered to you<br>
<br>
<br>
Commission Requirements<br>
--------------------------------<br>
I write NEW mods for the latest version of moddable minecraft (though I might consider a slightly earlier version if you ask).<br>
I only use Minecraft Forge for my mods.<br>
<br>
All my mods use a dependency mod called QLib. This is a library mod which makes my life easier when creating mods.<br>
Depending on the size of them mod, I may charge an extra fee if you do not want QLib to be a dependency (see Payrate)<br>
<br>
Once the commission is completed, I will continue to provide bug fixes for free for at least a year after release, and then until the latest moddable <br>minecraft version updates.<br>
Any additional features will be at an extra charge based on the time to add the feature (as if it was already part of the commission)<br>
Minecraft Version ports will be at an extra charge based on the amount of effort in porting the mod. In rare cases this could mean rewriting the entire mod.<br>
<br>
<br>
Payrate<br>
--------------------------------<br>
The payrate how much I charge per hour of work time.<br>
My base payrate is 10 GBP per hour, that's about 12-13 USD per hour.<br>
I will use this rate for most of the times unless there are a lot of commissions active, I am busy, or the commission is difficult.<br>
The payrate will not change for active commissions, once the price is set, it will not increase without consulting you.<br>
This base payrate may change in the future, so check everytime before commissions.<br>
<br>
I charge an extra 30 GBP if you wish for me to NOT use QLib (unless the mod is small). This is because it makes my life easier when I use it. This extra charge will change over time as I add more updates to QLib.<br>
<br>
<br>
Work Time<br>
--------------------------------<br>
Work time is the amount of time I will work on the project.<br>
This is NOT the ETA for how long the project will take;<br>
this is an estimation of the raw hours that I will have to work in order to complete the project.<br>
I will use this estimation with the payrate to calculate the final cost of the commission.<br>
<br>
I will work out an estimation and let you know about the final cost before the commission begins.<br>
<br>
I will update this section with average times to create various things like blocks, items, entities, dimensions etc. so that you can estimate the cost of the commission.<br>
<br>
<br>
Payment methods<br>
----------------------------------<br>
There are 3 payment methods that you can choose from for the commission:<br>
1) You are weird and you decide to pay me everything at once,<br>
2) The payments are split 50/50, first at the very start of the project, and last at the very end of the project<br>
3) We establish milestones for the features requested, and you pay me the established amount before the start of the next milestone.<br>
<br>
As for actual transactions I only accept paypal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Code Rights<br>
-------------------------------<br>
The code will remain closed-source under my rights UNTIL the commission has been completed and the all the payments have been made.<br>
At that point the project is to be made (AND REMAINED) open-source and all rights are transfered to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Refunds<br>
--------------------------------<br>
There are two cases for refunds: I cancel the commission, or you cancel the commission.<br>
<br>
If I cancel the commission, all the payments that were made so far will be refunded in full, and the code will remain with me with full permissions belonging to me.<br>
If by any chance you want to own the currently written code, then we will consult on the percentage of that payment which I will keep, and the code in the current state is released to you, as long as it stays open-source.<br>
<br>
If you cancel the commission, I will consult with you on the amount of work I have put in, I get to keep the percentage of the payments we agreed on and the code in the current state is released to you.<br>
If, on the other hand, we did not manage to agree on the percentage, I have the right to retain any payments that have been completed so far as well as the rights to the entire code will remain with me.<br>
Higher chances are that we will agree on something, I am not that scary.<br>
