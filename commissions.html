            <h2 class="page-header">Modding Commissions</h2>
            <p><b>Type:</b> Forge Mod Loader (FML)</p>
            <p><b>Minecraft Version:</b> 1.15.2 (Ask for older versions)</p>
            <p><b>Cost:</b> Around &#163;10 per hour of work time</p>
            <p><b>Work Time:</b> Estimated amount of time spent writing the mod (used for calculating the final cost)</p>
            <p><b>Payment Method:</b> Paypal</p>
            <p><b>Source Code:</b> To be made and remain open-source upon release (GPL3)</p>
            <p><b>Dependencies:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The commission will have to contain the QLib dependency (1.15.2+) which is a library mod I am developing.</li>
                <li>A fixed charge of &#163;30 will be applied if it is requested to not be used (unless the mod is small enough or below version 1.15.2)</li>
                <li>Ask about the exclusion of QLib and I will provide the details</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="page-header">Commission Requirements</h2>    
            <p>I write mods for the latest version of moddable Minecraft for the Forge Mod Loader.
            If you would like an earlier version then feel free to ask, however depending on the size of the mod I may refuse or charge extra.
            I am most comfortable with versions 1.12.2 and 1.14.4 as additional versions, however I much more prefer to use the latest moddable version.</p>
            <p>I create mods using QLib. It is a library mod I am developing for 1.15.2+ which allows me to write mods easier. Exclusion of QLib will come at an extra cost of &#163;30
            I may choose not to include QLib if the commission is small enough or below 1.15.2+</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h2 class="page-header">Worktime and Payrate</h2>
            <div>
                <h3>Payrate</h3>
                <p>The payrate is how much I charge per hour of work time.</p>
                <p>
                    My base payrate is <b>&#163;10</b> per hour,
                    that's about <b>12&#36;-13&#36;</b> per hour.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will use this rate for most of the times unless there are a
                    lot of commissions active, I am busy, or the commission is
                    difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The payrate will not change for active commissions, once the
                    price is set, it will not increase without consulting you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I charge an extra <b>&#163;30</b> if you wish
                    for me to NOT use QLib (unless the mod is small).
                    <br>
                    Consult me if you wish to not use QLib and I will let you know if I would charge you.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <h3>Worktime</h3>
                <p>
                    Worktime is NOT the ETA for how long the project will take.
                    This is an estimation of the total raw hours that I will have
                    put in order to complete the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will use this estimation with the payrate to calculate the
                    final cost of the commission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will work out an estimation and let you know about the final
                    cost before the commission begins.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h2 class="page-header">Charge Methods</h2>
            <p><b>All-In:</b> You are weird and you decide to pay me everything at once.</p>
            <p><b>50/50:</b> The payments are split 50/50, first at the very start of the project,
                and last at the very end of the project.</p>
            <p><b>Milestones:</b> We establish milestones for the features requested, and you pay
                me the established amount before the start of the next milestone.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h2 class="page-header">Refunds and Code Rights</h2>
            
            <div>
                <h3>Refunds</h3>
                <p><b>I cancel commission:</b></p>
                <p>
                    If I cancel the commission, all the payments that were made so
                    far will be refunded in full, and the code will remain with me
                    with full permissions belonging to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If by any chance you want to own the currently written code, then
                    we will consult on the percentage of that payment which I will
                    keep, and the code in the current state is released to you,
                    as long as it stays open-source.
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <p><b>You cancel commission:</b></p>
                <p>
                    If you cancel the commission, I will consult with you on the
                    amount of work I have put in, I get to keep the percentage of
                    the payments we agreed on and the code in the current state is
                    released to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If, on the other hand, we did not manage to agree on the
                    percentage, I have the right to retain any payments that have
                    been completed so far as well as the rights to the entire code
                    will remain with me.
                </p>
                <p><b>Higher chances are that we will agree on something,
                I am not that scary.</b></p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <h3>Code Rights</h3>
                <p>
                    The code will remain closed-source under my rights
                    <b>UNTIL</b> the commission has been completed and
                    the all the payments have been made.<br>
                    At that point the project is to be made
                    <b>(AND REMAINED)</b> open-source and all rights
                    are transfered to you.
