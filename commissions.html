        <h2 class="page-header">Modding Commissions</h2>
        <p><b>Type:</b> Forge Mod Loader (FML)</p>
        <p><b>Minecraft Version:</b> 1.16.5 (Ask for older versions)</p>
        <p><b>Cost:</b> &#163;15 per hour of work time</p>
        <p><b>Work Time:</b> Estimated amount of time spent writing the mod (used for calculating the final cost)</p>
        <p><b>Payment Method:</b> Paypal</p>
        <p><b>Source Code:</b> To be made and remain open-source upon release (GPL3)</p>
        <p><b>Resources:</b> I am not responsible for textures/models required for the commission</p>
        <!--
        <p><b>Dependencies:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The commission will have to contain the QLib dependency (1.15.2+) which is a library mod I am developing.</li>
            <li>A fixed charge of &#163;30 will be applied if it is requested to not be used (unless the mod is small enough or below version 1.15.2)</li>
            <li>Ask about the exclusion of QLib and I will provide the details</li>
        </ul>
        -->
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2 class="page-header">Commission Requirements</h2>
        <p>I write <b>Forge</b> Mods for the latest version of moddable Minecraft in a released stage.</p>
        <p>If you would like an earlier version then feel free to ask, however depending on the size of the mod I may
            refuse or charge extra.
        <p>I am not responsible for creating or updating any textures and/or models required for the commission. I am not an artist/modelerer and any textures/models I make are purely for development purposes, which may be used in the release if you wish.</p>
        <!--
        <p>I create mods using QLib. It is a library mod I am developing for 1.15.2+ which allows me to write mods easier. Exclusion of QLib will come at an extra cost of &#163;30
            I may choose not to include QLib if the commission is small enough or below 1.15.2+</p>
            -->
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="page-header">Maintains and Updates</h2>
        <p>Once the commission is completed, I will continue to provide bug fixes for free for 6 months after release,
            and then until the latest moddable minecraft version updates.</p>
        <p>Any additional features will be at an extra charge based on the time to add the feature (as if it was already
            part of the commission)</p>
        <p>Minecraft Version ports will be at an extra charge based on the amount of work time needed to port the
            mod.
            <b>In rare cases this could mean rewriting the entire mod.</b></p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="page-header">Worktime and Payrate</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Payrate</h3>
            <p>The payrate is how much I charge per hour of work time.</p>
            <p>My base payrate is <b>&#163;15</b> per hour,
                that's about <b>19&#36;-21&#36;</b> per hour.</p>
            <p>I will use this rate for most of the times unless there are a
                lot of commissions active, I am busy, or the commission is
                extra difficult.</p>
            <p>The payrate will not change for active commissions, once the
                price is set, it will not increase without consulting you.</p>
            <!--
            <p>
                I charge an extra <b>&#163;30</b> if you wish
                for me to NOT use QLib (unless the mod is small).
                <br>
                Consult me if you wish to not use QLib and I will let you know if I would charge you.
            </p>
            -->
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Worktime</h3>
            <p>Worktime is <b>NOT</b> the ETA for how long the project will take.
                This is an estimation of the total raw hours that I will have
                put in order to complete the project.</p>
            <p>I will use this estimation with the payrate to calculate the
                final cost of the commission.</p>
            <p>I will work out an estimation and let you know about the final
                cost before the commission begins.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="page-header">Charge Methods</h2>
        <p><b>All-In:</b> You are weird and you decide to pay me everything at once.</p>
        <p><b>50/50:</b> The payments are split 50/50, first at the very start of the project,
            and last at the very end of the project.</p>
        <p><b>Milestones:</b> We establish milestones for the features requested, and you pay
            me the established amount before the start of the next milestone.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="page-header">Refunds and Code Rights</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Refunds</h3>
            <p><b>I cancel commission:</b></p>
            <p>If I cancel the commission, all the payments that were made so
                far will be refunded in full, and the code will remain with me
                with full permissions belonging to me.</p>
            <p>If by any chance you want to own the currently written code, then
                we will consult on the percentage of that payment which I will
                keep, and the code in the current state is released to you,
                as long as it stays open-source.</p>
            <br>

            <p><b>You cancel commission:</b></p>
            <p>If you cancel the commission, I will consult with you on the
                amount of work I have put in, I get to keep the percentage of
                the payments we agreed on and the code in the current state is
                released to you.</p>
            <p>If, on the other hand, we did not manage to agree on the
                percentage, I have the right to retain any payments that have
                been completed so far as well as the rights to the entire code
                will remain with me.</p>
            <p><b>Higher chances are that we will agree on something,
                I am not that scary.</b></p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Code Rights</h3>
            <p>The code will remain under my rights
                <b>UNTIL</b> the commission has been completed and
                the all the payments have been made.<br>
                At that point the mod will be yours however the code
                will remain under my rights and open-source.</p>
